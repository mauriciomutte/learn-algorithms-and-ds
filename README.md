# Learn: Algorithms and Data Structures

📚 My journey learning Algorithms &amp; Data Structures

## Fundamentals

Build the the foundation by learning the fundamental algorithms and data structures

**Data Structures:**

- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Graphs

**Algorithms:**

- [ ] Searching: Linear Search, [Binary Search](./algorithms/binary-search.py)
- [ ] Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Linked list

## Practice Problems

You could explore my solutions to a series of coding exercises in the [`leetcode` directory](./leetcode/).
