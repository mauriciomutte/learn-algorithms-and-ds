## 1. Introduction to algorithms

### 1.1 Introduction

"One algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem"

### 1.2 Binary search

- _Binary search_ is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array

### 1.3 Big O

- Big O notation is a way to describe the performance of an algorithm
- Big O notation is about the worst-case scenario

**Some common Big O run times**

- O(log n) -> log time
- O(n) -> linear time
- O(n \* log n) -> log-linear time
- O(n2) -> quadratic time
- O(n!) -> factorial time
